2. Node.JS and NPM on Windows 
    - Since you are going to use JavaScript for your React development on Windows, 
    there is no way around Node.js and NPM. 
    - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime which makes it possible to run JavaScript 
    outside of the browser.

    - NPM is used to install libraries, such as React.js, to your project on the 
    command line.

3. Using NODE and NPM in VS CODE's Integrated terminal
     - in VS Code open a code called "Terminal" and enter the follwing commmands: 
        node --version
        npm --version

4. Using Vite 
    - Vite allows you to start React applications with zero-configuration.
    - create your first React.js application 
        (1) create a directory where you want to create your project. In this case
            cd C:\_AMyReactDev

        (2) Open a VSCode terminal:
            npm create vite@latest my-first-react-project -- --template react
            cd my-first-react-project
            npm install
            npm run dev - This command line should give you an output where you can find the application in the browser. 
                          The default should be http://localhost:5173/
                          (Press Ctl=C to terminate app)

5. GIT FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND WINDOWS
     - go to https://git-scm.com/ and install git (look for Download for Windows button)
     - after installing from VS Code do: git --version
