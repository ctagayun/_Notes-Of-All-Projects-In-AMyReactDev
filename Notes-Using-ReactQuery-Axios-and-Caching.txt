     - This version aims to update the screen data by using
       shared state, caching, controlled re-fetches and retries.
       In addition this version of the app will prevent HouseList hook
       to execute each time it is used. This can be accomplised using 
       "React-Query"

     - first npm install axios@1 - we will use this library instead of 
       "fetch"
 
     - npm install @tanstack/react-query@5

     - go to globom3-6-keep-screen-updated-by-using-axios-caching-and-react-query

     - modify src/hooks/HouseHooks.ts to use useQuery and Axios

     - after that modify src/house/houseList to call the new useFetchHouses

     - we have one more thing we have to do. Go to src/main.tsx.
       React Query relies on QueryClient object. we instantiate that
       object and use a QueryClientProvider to make it available to all
       child components.
      
     - Finally test it: 
         - dotnet run on API project 
         - npm run dev on Reactweb
